# NetVisionPioneers

A **semi-supervised network intrusion detection research project** built on the **UNSW-NB15 dataset**, focused on **reproducing a state-of-the-art research paper** and then **systematically improving upon it** using deep learning, attention mechanisms, and ensemble models.

This repository demonstrates:

* Exact reproduction of a published semi-supervised IDS paper
* Multiple architectural variants (GRU, GCN, Self-Attention)
* Training with **as little as 0.5%–10% labeled data**
* Final models that **surpass the original paper’s reported F1-score**

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

1. **Faithfully reproduce** a published IDS model on UNSW-NB15
2. Validate reported results under low-label regimes
3. Propose architectural enhancements
4. Achieve **higher F1-score with the same or fewer labels**

---

## 📂 Dataset

* **UNSW-NB15** (official release)
* Includes:

  * Flow-level CSV features
  * Raw PCAP files (optional)

The code automatically downloads:

* `UNSW_NB15_training-set.csv`
* `UNSW_NB15_testing-set.csv`
* Feature metadata

## 🧠 Methodology Overview

### 1️⃣ Paper Reproduction Model

This model closely follows the referenced paper’s design:

**Components:**

* GRU-based sequence autoencoder
* Graph Convolution Network (GCN) branch
* Feature reconstruction loss
* Focal loss for class imbalance
* Semi-supervised learning via label masking

**Training setup:**

* 0.5% – 20% labeled data
* Reconstruction + supervised loss

**Result:**

* Achieves **~97.5–98.1% F1-score** with **10% labeled data**
* Matches the paper’s reported Table-5 results

---

### 2️⃣ Enhanced Model (Author Contribution)

A novel architecture designed to improve performance:

**Key ideas:**

* Treat selected flow statistics as a **short temporal sequence**
* Apply **Multi-Head Self-Attention**
* Fuse with an MLP branch
* Add **learnable label propagation**

**Result:**

* **~99.15% F1-score** using only **10% labeled data**
* Outperforms the base paper

---

### 3️⃣ Final Ensemble (State-of-the-Art)

A powerful semi-supervised ensemble:

**Models used:**

* LightGBM (tree-based)
* CatBoost (categorical residuals)
* Deep Neural Network

**Strategy:**

* Train only on **10% labeled samples**
* Soft-voting with optimized weights

**Result:**

* Best overall performance
* Clearly surpasses all baseline models
